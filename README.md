RATIONALE

I aimed to translate my website prototype of Architect Robin Boyd’s work, into a functioning code that can be used. I started off by following my prototype closely, and that paid off. Having a clear design in front of me meant I always knew what to code next, and I felt confident breaking the work into bite-sized pieces. The sticky navigation bar was a big win—I love how it stays at the top while you scroll, and it makes the usability of the site more accessible.

On the flip side, Implementing tables for layout was harder than anticipated; I had to revisit CSS properties repeatedly to maintain correct spacing and responsiveness. The biggest hurdle was the image slider feature that was in my initial prototype. It was an olive-green carousel showcasing Boyd’s diverse portfolio on the homepage. Despite extensive research, I struggled to assemble the multiple interlocking components in a stable, responsive way. After several, I decided to go with a simpler image gallery. While it departs slightly from my original vision, I’m pleased with its clean look.

My wireframes and high-fidelity mock-ups were super helpful. These prototypes guided the folder structure, page layouts, and core interface elements. Wherever possible, I matched colours, typography, and spacing to the designs. For example, the hero section’s typography hierarchy and image placement closely mirror the prototype. The prototype helped me decide how many images to display and how users should interact with them.

I used a couple of sites to assist my structure and how to achieve certain elements of my prototype:
1.	CodePen (https://codepen.io/)
Usage: Explored community pens for image carousel implementations and CSS grid/table layouts.
Annotation: Sample “responsive carousel” pens clarified how others structure HTML, style transitions.
2.	MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/)
Usage: Verified CSS properties (e.g., position: sticky, display: table) and learned best practices for responsive tables.
Annotation: The “Using CSS sticky positioning” guide directly informed my navigation bar implementation.

Whenever I encountered a roadblock—particularly in JavaScrip, formatting, or creating specific elements from my prototype I attempted to use AI:
•	Icon Design: I prompted AI to generate a icon for the site header
•	Code Review: AI helped look over parts of the code that weren’t working and changed it to be functional.
•	JavaScript: For both the original slider attempt and the final gallery, I asked AI to draft functions for image preloading and click handlers.
•	Problem-Solving: When I felt stuck on a CSS selector or a responsive breakpoint, AI would suggest alternate approaches.
Using AI in this way accelerated my learning, but I always validated its suggestions against other documentation and my own tests.

A recurring frustration was my folder and file naming. Early on, I used arbitrary names which later made linking parts of the site extremely difficult. Moving forwards, I to avoid confusion, I need to organise my files, links and names clearer to make the coding process a bit more seamless.

This project deepened my appreciation for the gap between design and implementation. While prototypes are invaluable guides, real-world constraints sometimes demand creative pivots - as with the image gallery substitute. Moving forward, I’ll invest more time in naming conventions upfront and prototype interactivity earlier, perhaps by creating simple live demos before coding full pages. Overall, the experience strengthened my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, and I’m excited to build on this foundation in future web design projects.
