    <p class="paragraph-2">The Fenner House at 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill, was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952–53 for Professor Frank Fenner, an internationally acclaimed Australian virologist known for his work on smallpox and myxomatosis. It exemplifies Boyd’s post-war Melbourne regional style, featuring a distinctive long, unbroken roofline, widely projecting eaves, extensive timber-framed glazing, vertical boarding, and a notable glass-walled entry gallery joining two wings. Listed by the ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects, the house won Canberra’s first Meritorious Architecture Award in 1956. It remains significant for its architectural innovation, historical associations with early academics at the Australian National University, and its integration within a garden designed by prominent Canberra landscape architect Lindsay Pryor.</p>
    <div class="text-block-5">Description:</div>
    <div class="text-block-5">The house is set well back diagonally on a large corner block that slopes several metres from rear to front. The building consists of two parallel, off-set wings facing north-north-east which represent two living zones: the bedrooms, bathrooms and study in the rear wing and the eating and entertainment areas in the front wing. The two wings are linked by an enclosed, glass walled gallery.<br><br>The construction is double brick, with large areas of glazing in full height narrow timber frames. The brickwork is bagged and painted—grey on the north-south walls and white on the east-west walls, both original colours. The area underneath the glazing is painted in the original ‘celadon’ green colour. The roof is a long, unbroken, low pitch gable with internally raked ceilings.<br><br>In 1982 a large extension was added to the western end of the rear wing with a separate entrance off Torres Street. The extension was designed by Canberra designer Bill Douglas with the intention of being as close as possible in external appearance to the original part of the house. The roofline remains unbroken and the detailing of the eaves and glazing is identical to the original. At the rear, the extended portion of the building is approximately 1 metre deeper than the original rear wing.</div>
