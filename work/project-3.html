      <p class="paragraph-2">The Manning Clark House, designed by Robin Boyd in 1952 for historian Professor Manning Clark, exemplifies Boyd&#x27;s post-war Melbourne regional style with its low-pitched roof, wide eaves, and extensive timber-framed glazing. Located at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest, the house features two wings connected by a glass-walled entry passage and courtyards enclosed by brick grills. Clark&#x27;s influential historical works, notably his six-volume History of Australia, were written here. The building remains largely intact, is listed as significant by the ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects, and continues to be preserved as a cultural site.</p>
      <div class="text-block-5">Description:</div>
      <div class="text-block-5">The house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well laid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber framed windows and metal deck roof.<br><br>Two separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance. Either side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south. The walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other. Similar brick grill detailing can be seen on the Melbourne regional style Forrest Townhouses and 4 Cobby Street (both by Roy Grounds).<br><br>Positioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to the study is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.<br><br>The living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves. The living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.<br><br>Only minor alterations have been made to house. A pergola was added to extend the sunshade over the north facing windows of the study and a carport was built on to the side of the house near the entry area. The house is in excellent condition.</div>
